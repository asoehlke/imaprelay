imaprelay
=========

``imaprelay`` is a Home Assistnt plug-in to distribute e-mails from one mail box to different recipients.

``imaprelay``, logs into an IMAP
account and relays emails from the Inbox to a specified email address,
via an SMTP server. Once relayed, emails are "archived" -- moved out of
the inbox into a different folder.

Although usable programmatically [#code]_, it is expected that most people
will  want to use the ``imaprelay`` command-line tool that this package
provides.

For usage documentation see DOCS.md.
